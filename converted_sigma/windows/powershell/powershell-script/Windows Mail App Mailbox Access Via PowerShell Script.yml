name: "Windows Mail App Mailbox Access Via PowerShell Script"
description: |
  Detects PowerShell Script Block Logging events that reference the Windows Mail app mailbox storage path
  (\Comms\Unistore\data). Access to this path can indicate manipulation of, collection of, or attempted
  exfiltration/deletion of stored user emails from the default Windows Mail app (Mail/Calendar).
  Requirements: PowerShell Script Block Logging must be enabled.
  False positives: Unknown (may occur with legitimate mail troubleshooting or backup tooling, depending on environment).
  Triage: Review script content for file copy/delete/search actions, confirm the user context, check the parent process
  and execution origin (interactive vs. scheduled/remote), and correlate with file access (if available), archive creation,
  or outbound network activity shortly after.
