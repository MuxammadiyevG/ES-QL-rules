name: "New Windows Firewall Rule Added Via New-NetFirewallRule Cmdlet - ScriptBlock"
description: |
  Detects PowerShell Script Block Logging events where a script invokes New-NetFirewallRule with an Allow action.
  Attackers may add permissive firewall rules to enable inbound access, lateral movement, or persistence, or to
  facilitate ransomware operations.
  Requirements: PowerShell Script Block Logging must be enabled.
  False positives: Administrator scripts, endpoint management tooling, legitimate application installation.
  Triage: Review the full script block for rule parameters (Direction, LocalPort, RemoteAddress, Program/Service),
  identify the initiating user and parent process, and correlate with other firewall changes (Set/Remove-NetFirewallRule),
  new listening services, suspicious network connections, or post-exploitation activity.
