name: "WinAPI Library Calls Via PowerShell Scripts"
description: |
  Detects PowerShell Script Block Logging events referencing common WinAPI libraries (Advapi32.dll, kernel32.dll,
  KernelBase.dll, ntdll.dll, secur32.dll, user32.dll). Attackers often call WinAPI via .NET interop / Add-Type /
  P/Invoke to perform actions that may evade detections focused on typical PowerShell cmdlets/functions.
  Use this as a hunting baseline and tune for your environment.
  Requirements: PowerShell Script Block Logging must be enabled.
  False positives: Carbon PowerShell Module, Chocolatey scripts, and other legitimate automation that uses WinAPI.
  Triage: Review the script block for Add-Type / DllImport / Marshal usage, suspicious API functions (VirtualAlloc,
  WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread, OpenProcess, MiniDumpWriteDump), and correlate with process injection,
  credential dumping, or unusual child processes/network activity.
