name: "Microsoft Office Trusted Location Updated"
description: |
  Detects registry modifications that add or update Microsoft Office Trusted Locations.
  Attackers may add malicious directories as trusted locations to bypass Office macro
  security controls and execute macro-enabled documents without warnings.
  False positives: Common during Office installation, upgrades, Click-to-Run operations,
  or legitimate administrative configuration.
  Triage: Identify the Office application/version affected, review the added trusted path,
  verify the modifying process and user, and correlate with subsequent Office document
  execution, macro activity, or suspicious child processes.
